# The effects of electoral restrictions on the quality of politicians: The case of the U.S.

# Guide to Replication
In order the replicate this project, please run the final.R file which is located in the main directory.


# Data

The data needed to replicate come from two fifferent sources. The first peice comes the VoteSmart Project's website, and the second piece comes from the census date. To scrape the data from the VoteSmart Project's website, you need to have your own API code([here](https://votesmart.org/share/api#.XNNvSI5Kg2w)) since I am not allowed to share mine. The data scrapping process might take up to one week.
I have uploaded the census data that I made use of for this paper in the main directory. It is called city.xlsx.
